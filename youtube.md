Level 1. 
    get started ! (lots of fear, lack of confidence etc)
        can upload a video as unlisted (no one see it)
        can publish video and no one sees it

    topic can be simple

    choice 1:
        1. breakup with YT after a few videos ?
        2. casual (fun) or srious relationship (consistant) ?
    
    about 30 videos
    if 2 => level 2


Level 2.
    Get good at making videos

    make many videos !!! ===> makes quality

    just make videos 1-2/week

    Quality : 
        - title
        - thumbnail
        - hook
        - personality
        - camera
        - editing
        - music
        - writing

    don't do everything all at once at beginning

    Good videos:
        - intrinsic = level of cringe of your videos
        - extrinsic = click & watched (win!) {metrics, engagement}
    
    about 80 videos
    >>> passed the cringe test

    choice 2:
        - is this a hobby (fun)? business (money)? {spectrum}

        business side can have the joy diminished

    >>> if business => level 3

----------------------------
Level 3.
    80 - 100 videos

    get smart (move to business side)

    care about marketing, viewers, brand

    workflow

        strategize 
            goals
            niche
            competitive analysis
            competitive advantage
            planning 
            pivoting (based on data)

        systemize
            "The E Myth" - Michael E. Gerber (required book)

    cashflow
        value
        products
    outflow

Mistakes , lessons learned

don't look at analytics 
enjoy what you are doing
focus on making great content
don't worry about missing scheduled uploads
communicate with audience
collab helps channel & learning opportunity


1. be focused on what your theme/topic, be consistant
    is this going to have momentum for years?
2. get rid of the entitlement, it is a marathon, earn every view and subscriber, value what you have
3. too much stress about views instead of making videos, takes time for videos to get noticed 
4. thumbnails matter! 
5. fear, procrastination just make video regardless. 
6. don't copy others, be you!! 
7. not staying focused on making content
8. try to find fellow YouTubers on same theme/topic, reach out
9. fear of judgement delayed
10. try to predict what subscribers want, trends come/go, think long game, do what motivates you


when channel is small, communicate with audience CREATE CONTENT FOR AUDIENCE

stop wasting on time on being perfect, small details just make content

you don't need all the best gear, you & story is what matters

TITLE & THUMBNAIL MATTERS

click-through-rate (for later)
audience retention (how long they watch)

be you and not an alias

have a hook, clear what you want to talk about
    what's in it for them?
    what will they get oyt of it?
    benefits? 
    takeaways?

once you see video doing well, pay attention to those,
go deeper on that content 

GO DEEPER NOT WIDE on topic

be focused on topic so subscribers know

YouTube is 2nd search engine, provide information = provide value . help viewers find you

SERVE 1 AUDIENCE!! 

Sponsorship/ ads can happen 
have a history working on topic

low watch view rate means YT does not recommend your video

don't advertize/self promote videos


YouTuber channel - general 
income per 1000 views
total views * $2 (male) / 1000
total views * $6 (female) / 1000


Amazon affiliate links do make money


YouTubers = self employed, pay different tax rate

do YT for love not the money, it's not much money
