**consigned goods** = a business holds goods belonging to other parties and sells them for a fee without taking any ownership of the goods

**internal controls** = systems designed to help an organization achieve reliable financial reporting effective and efficient operations and compliance with relevant laws and regulations

**specific identification cost formula** = tracks the actual physical flow of the goods in a perpetual inventory system. Each item of inventory is marked, tagged, or coded with specific unit cost so at any time cost of the ending inventory and cost of goods sold can be determined.


**First In First Out (FIFO)** = average cost formula, assumes that the earlist (oldest) goods purchased are the first ones to be sold. the costs of the oldest unites are recognized first in cost of goods sold


**lower of cost and net realizable value (LCNRV)** = when net realizable value of inventory is lower than its cost, inventory is written down to its net realizable value

**net realizable value (NRV)** = the selling price ,less any costs required to make the goods ready for sale 

**inventory turnover** = ratio measures the number of times on average that  inventory is sold during the period. The cost of goods sold divided by the average inventory
